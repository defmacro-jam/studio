# **App Name**: RetroSpectify

## Core Features:

- Sentiment Poll: Weekly team poll with star ratings (1-5) and justification text boxes. Justifications are categorized into 'what went well' or 'what could be improved' based on the star rating provided. LLM will decide which category to put the justification into, acting as a tool to facilitate the retro discussion
- Retro Board: Sections for 'What Went Well', 'What Could Be Improved', 'Discussion Topics', and 'Action Items'. Users can post items to these sections, and others can reply. Accounts are associated with avatars.
- User Accounts: User authentication with avatar display.
